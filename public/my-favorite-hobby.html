        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p> I can clearly remember when I was around 9 years old, my mother would let me borrow her
            iPod, and I would mostly listen to songs that I knew from the radio, and that was a pretty normal thing to do,
            but one day, when my mom got new music, I opened the door into my long journy into metal music. My mother
            got Metallica's S&M album, and the first song I heard from it was <em>Battery</em>, and it was the heaviest
            thing I could imagine. I listend to it nonstop, and fixated on Metallica for about 4 years. But as I got older,
            I started to want something new, I journied into Power Metal with Man'O'War and Dragonforce. But after a phase of
            power metal, I wanted something <strong>heavier</strong>, so I moved into melodic death metal with Amon Amarth.
            When you start listening to death metal, and you like it, you start to crave heavier and <strong>HEAVIER</strong>
            metal. That is the phase I would say I am in right now, I have not lost love for any of the <em>lighter</em>
            metal, but I have gained a interest in finding nastier and heavier metal.</p>

        <p> Over the years of listening to metal, one of my favorite things to do, involving metal, is going to concerts.
            I can't even begin to think of how many concerts I have gone to, some of them blur together, but I have so many great
            memories from concerts. I get to enjoy the music I love, be with friends, have a good time, and mosh and headbang
            till I know I will be sore the next few days. By going to concerts I have also been able to see musicians that
            I idolize. I have been fortunate enough to see such legends as Iron Maidan, Slayer, Megadeth, and not only Ozzy on his
            own, <strong>TWICE</strong>, but I even was lucky enough to go to Black Sabbath's final tour! Being able to see
            the band that was resposible for creating the genre <strong>50 YEARS AGO</strong> still blows my mind.
